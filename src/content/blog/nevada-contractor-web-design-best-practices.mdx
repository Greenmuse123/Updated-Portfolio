    title: "Why Contractors Need Better Websites"
    paragraphs:
      - "Bids are won or lost online before you even shake hands. Homeowners skim three contractor sites, judge trustworthiness in 8 seconds, then only call the one that ‘feels’ reliable. A dated layout or slow load kills you before price comes up."
  - id: must-have-elements
    title: "Must-Have Elements (License #, Testimonials, Forms)"
    paragraphs:
      - "Nevada’s Contractors Board requires license display on marketing materials. Put it in the header AND footer. Follow with quick-scan trust badges (BBB, Yelp, Google stars) and a 30-second quote form above the fold."
    list:
      items:
        - "License number clickable to Board lookup"
        - "Scrolling marquee of 5-star review snippets"
        - "Simple form: name, phone, project type, zip code"

    title: "Mobile Speed & Trust-Building UX"
    paragraphs:
      - "Contractor searches are 72% mobile. Compress hero images to <150 KB, defer non-critical JS, and use a sticky CTA bar with \"Call Now\" and \"Get Quote\" buttons."
  - id: seo-city-targeting
    title: "SEO for ‘Contractor + City’ Targeting"
    paragraphs:
      - "Create service-area pages: \"HVAC Repair Henderson\", \"Roof Replacement Reno\". Include city in H1, meta title, and first 100 words. Embed Google Maps with driving-directions link."

    title: "Google Reviews & Before/After Galleries"
    paragraphs:
      - "Integrate your Google reviews widget sitewide. Photos prove skill—add interactive sliders showing before & after roofing, siding, or concrete work. Include alt text = \"Las Vegas roof replacement before and after\" for image SEO."
  - id: conclusion
    title: "Conclusion"
    paragraphs:
      - "Your website should close deals 24/7. With license visibility, blazing speed, local SEO pages, and conversion-driving galleries, you’ll win trust—and bids—before you even pick up the ladder."

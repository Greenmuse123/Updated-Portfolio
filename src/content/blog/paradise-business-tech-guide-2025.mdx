    title: "Why Paradise Vendors Need Specialized Tech"
    paragraphs:
      - "Paradise—the unincorporated home of the iconic Las Vegas Strip—attracts 42 million visitors a year. Its sidewalk kiosks, food trucks, and gift shops face extreme customer volume, seasonal spikes, and late-night demand. Generic small-business tech advice doesn’t cut it. You need tools built for crowds, cash-heavy audiences, and instant gratification."
      - "This guide distills the must-have technologies for 2025 that solve Paradise-specific pain points: long lines, hit-and-run customers, and fierce local competition."
  - id: mobile-pos
    title: "Mobile POS for High-Volume Locations"
    paragraphs:
      - "Lines kill impulse buys. A mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) slashes wait times by letting staff run cards tableside or curbside. Square Terminal and Toast Go are popular, but 2025 brings Tap-to-Pay on iPhone and Android—no extra hardware needed."
      - "Key Requirements:"
    list:
      items:
        - "Offline mode—Wi-Fi on the Strip is spotty."
        - "Tip prompts configured for take-out."
        - "Multi-location reporting (for moving food trucks)."
    paragraphsAfter:
      - "Pro Tip: Use color-coded receipt printers—one for bar drinks, another for kitchen—to keep orders flowing even during late-night surges."
  - id: customer-experience-tech
    title: "Customer-Experience Tech: QR Menus & Fast Booking"
    paragraphs:
      - "COVID normalized QR menus; 2025 perfects them. Use dynamic QR codes linked to a headless CMS so you can swap specials in minutes. For bars and lounges, integrate a two-tap booking widget (Tock or Resy) for VIP tables right inside the menu."
      - "Benefits:"
    list:
      items:
        - "Cuts printing costs by 90%."
        - "Captures emails for remarketing when patrons view the menu."
        - "Upsells by spotlighting premium combos before customers order."
  - id: wifi-analytics
    title: "Guest Wi-Fi & Analytics"
    paragraphs:
      - "Guests expect free Wi-Fi—even at a food truck. Deploy a cloud-managed router (Ubiquiti UniFi or Cisco Meraki Go) that forces a captive-portal login. Trade bandwidth for data: names, emails, or social logins."
      - "What to track: dwell time, repeat visits, and peak hours. Feed this data into your POS to trigger automatic happy-hour promos or SMS coupons when foot traffic dips."
  - id: local-seo
    title: "Local SEO & Late-Night Google Maps Optimization"
    paragraphs:
      - "Tourists search “food near me” at 2 AM. If your Maps listing says you close at midnight, Google hides you. Use the new Google Business Profile API events to auto-extend hours on weekends."
      - "SEO Checklist:"
    list:
      items:
        - "Add \"open-late\" and \"24 hours\" text in descriptions."
        - "Upload geotagged images every week."
        - "Collect reviews that mention Paradise, Strip, or nearby casinos."
  - id: real-use-case
    title: "Use Case: Turning a Strip Food Truck into a Data Machine"
    paragraphs:
      - "Joe’s Tacos saw 35-minute lines on fight nights. We deployed Square mPOS + a UniFi Wi-Fi portal. Average order time fell to 90 seconds, and 1,200 emails were captured in a month. A midnight happy-hour SMS campaign bumped revenue 22%."
  - id: conclusion
    title: "Conclusion"
    paragraphs:
      - "Paradise vendors compete in the world’s loudest marketplace. With the right tech stack—mobile POS, QR menus, guest Wi-Fi analytics, and late-night SEO—you’ll turn one-time tourists into loyal customers and keep the cash flowing long after the neon fades."

    paragraphs:
      - "If you run a spa or medical office in Summerlin, you might not realize that your website could be putting you at legal risk, turning away potential customers, and even hurting your Google rankings. ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliance isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s a must. Let’s explore why this matters now more than ever."
  - id: "legal-risks"
    title: "Legal Risks: Real Lawsuit Examples"
    paragraphs:
      - "Businesses across the U.S., including small wellness and medical offices, have faced lawsuits for non-ADA-compliant websites. For instance, a Florida medical practice settled for $20,000 in 2021 after a visually impaired user couldn’t access their appointment booking system. In California, a spa chain faced similar litigation costing over $50,000 in legal fees and damages for lacking screen reader compatibility."
      - "Summerlin businesses are not immune. With increasing awareness, plaintiffs and law firms are targeting small businesses whose websites fail to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards."
      - "Action Step: Audit your website for basic accessibility issues like missing alt text on images or unnavigable menus. Consider a professional review to avoid costly lawsuits."
  - id: "lost-customers"
    title: "Lost Customers: Accessibility Barriers"
    paragraphs:
      - "A non-compliant website can alienate a significant portion of your Summerlin clientele. Over 15% of Americans have some form of disability, including visual, auditory, or motor impairments. If they can’t navigate your site to book a massage or check medical services, they’ll go to a competitor who offers an accessible experience."
      - "Action Step: Ensure your site supports screen readers, has keyboard navigation, and offers text alternatives for images. Test with tools like WAVE to see what barriers exist."
  - id: "seo-penalty"
    title: "SEO Penalty: Google Cares About Accessibility"
    paragraphs:
      - "Google’s algorithms increasingly factor in accessibility as part of user experience. Websites that aren’t ADA-compliant often have poor usability metrics, which can lower your search rankings. For Summerlin spas and medical offices relying on local SEO, this can mean fewer online bookings."
      - "Action Step: Fix accessibility issues to improve site usability scores. Google rewards sites that load well for all users, including those using assistive technologies."
  - id: "ada-packages"
    title: "My ADA-Compliant Packages for Summerlin Businesses"
    paragraphs:
      - "I offer tailored solutions to bring your Summerlin spa or medical office website up to ADA standards. My packages include a full accessibility audit, remediation of issues like alt text and ARIA labels, and ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines."
